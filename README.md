**MiYaku Disclaimer:**
===========

Credits belong to the original hacker, unknownbrackets, that worked on the original translation for this game, MiYaku has only referenced the original Japanese Script to be as accurate and uncensored as possible.
Any work toward unknownbracket's translation has been abandoned and unknownbrackets will reference my Translation.
Please be aware that this is my translation alone, if you want something different, check out the original from unknownbrackets.
Currently, the majority of the Englsih Translation is from unknownbracket's work and some of it is a bit inaccurate and is his own style, that is why this is in an experimental phase.
Eventually, the original Translation attempt will be completely replaced with my own.

You can find my translations in the Commit section above and build it if you want to, follow the instructions below by unknownbrackets.

Now from the original team below.

Description
===========

Tools and hacks to allow fan translation and localization of the Game Boy Advance game, Tomato
Adventure.


Basic usage
===========

Beware: these are tools to translate the game, this is not a translation.  Usage is meant for
translators.

1. Download or clone this repo into a new folder.
2. Place the image of the game in the same folder, named `ta.gba`.
3. Modify the txt files found in the folder.
4. Run the `i.bat` command on Windows.
5. Review the test.gba image outputted.


Features
===========

As of writing, some of these features are still in progress.

 * Variable width font in menus, dialogs, battle, etc.
 * Dynamic or increased lengths for names, descriptions, and other text.
 * Inserter for text, pointers, and images.
 * Longer character names.
 * Save compatibility with the original game.

Missing features can be found in issues on GitHub.


Translation files
===========

Text is grouped into multiple files.  As of writing, files have an eng and jpn version.  The jpn
files can be used as referenced but are not used by the inserter.

### ta_script_eng.txt

This contains the main dialog text, which is shown using an 8x12 font.  A scripting language
triggers these messages, but they are given IDs to facilitate translation.

Note that some messages are reused (for example, when getting a Gimmick.)  Some messages are
unused in the game.

See [SCRIPT.md] for the codes used in this file.

### ta_enemies_eng.txt

This contains both enemy names and their attack names.  Both are limited to 24 characters.

These names are shown during battle using an 8x8 font.

### ta_battle_eng.txt

This contains messages shown during battle based on the scripting for enemies.  They display
using an 8x8 font.

May be prefixed with [CENTER_H] for alignment.  Some original messages were manually centered.

Some strings may be reused by multiple enemies.

### ta_menus_eng.txt

This contains menu text and related messages shown in:

 * The primary menu
 * Battle and battle menus
 * Shops
 * Naming screen
 * The Gimica sub game

This text is all shown using the 8x8 font.  See [MENUS.md] for format details.

### ta_gimica_tutorial_eng.txt

This is a list of messages shown during the Gimica tutorial.  These display using an 8x8 font.

The number of lines can be changed, but each much end in [BREAK] or [END].

### Mock insertion

To force all known strings to be inserted, use --force, as in any of:

```
i.bat --force
armips tomatoadv.asm && a --force
```

This will replace all Japanese characters with an ID followed by As.  The ID can be used to find
the translation within files the inserter uses.


Images
===========

Images are inserted as part of the process, but currently they have space limitations and must
reuse the same palettes as the original images.


Emulator & hardware
===========

The changes are intended to work on common emulators and on hardware, but have not been tested
everywhere.  Contributions are welcome to improve support.

A patch is included that fixes a game bug which breaks saving in [no$gba][].


Platforms
===========

These tools were designed to be portable, but a compiler is required on platforms other than
Windows.  Steps to complete before the basic usage:

1. Install or compile [armips][].
2. Compile the inserter, similar to: `pushd inserter && make && popd`
3. Use `armips tomatoadv.asm && ./a` instead of `i.bat`.
