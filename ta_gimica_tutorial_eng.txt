00-E:All right so, the rules...[BREAK]
First of all, we each have 200HP.[END]

01-E:My HP's on the left...[END]

02-E:And your HP is on the right.[BREAK]
Anyhow, if your HP hits 0, or...[BREAK]
if you have less HP than your enemy[BREAK]
at the end of a match, you lose.[END]

03-E:There's 2 cards in the middle.[BREAK]
You use their power to...[BREAK]
deal damage to your opponent.[END]

04-E:The one on the left's my Gimmick Card.[END]

05-E:The right one's yours.[BREAK]
These Gimmick Cards are related to[BREAK]
the Gimmicks you've collected.[BREAK]
But, they come out at random...[BREAK]
The card ranks are between them.[BREAK]
From strongest to weakest, they're...[END]

06-E:1st: Blue.[END]

07-E:2nd: Red.[END]

08-E:3rd: Yellow.[END]

09-E:The weakest is green.[BREAK]
But, the green rank is special...[BREAK]
Green beats the strongest blue cards.[BREAK]
For cards of the same rank,[BREAK]
the higher number wins.[BREAK]
That's how card ranks work.[BREAK]
Got it? Next up, damage calculation.[END]

0A-E:Just take the higher number, and...[END]

0B-E:Subtract the smaller number from it.[BREAK]
But color beats number,[BREAK]
so don't get all excited just cause...[BREAK]
you have big numbers.[BREAK]
You may still end up taking damage...[END]

0C-E:In summary...[BREAK]
Color decides the winner.[BREAK]
Damage is the difference...[BREAK]
between the two numbers.[BREAK]
But it'd be pretty weak if...[BREAK]
that was the whole game.[END]

0D-E:On the bottom, you've got 5 cards...[BREAK]
These are Character Cards...[BREAK]
You can augment the power of your[BREAK]
Gimmick cards by playing them.[BREAK]
For instance...[END]

0E-E:Rank [F8] moves a card up 1 color.[END]

0F-E:Rank [FA] moves a card down 1 color.[END]

10-E:Point [F8] increases a card's number.[END]

11-E:Point [FA] decreases a card's number.[END]

12-E:There's a lot of other cards too,[BREAK]
so try 'em out for yourself.[BREAK]
You must always play a card.[BREAK]
Think carefully about what order[BREAK]
you wanna play 'em in.[BREAK]
I could play the same cards that you[BREAK]
have, and it's exciting not knowing[BREAK]
how a match'll turn out.[BREAK]
Whosever HP hits zero first, or...[BREAK]
is the lowest after their 5 cards[BREAK]
have been played, is the loser.[END]

13-E:Once you run out of playable cards,[BREAK]
all that will remain is the tomato[BREAK]
on the left, which is not a card.[END]

14-E:So, them's the rules. Got it?[END]
