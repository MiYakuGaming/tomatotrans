That is certainly the[BREAK]
quality of art eh![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

00A-E:Dreams and Reality[BREAK]
Front and Back.....[CONTINUE]
I wonder which is the[BREAK]
truth of the World?[WAIT]
This Bed certainly knows[BREAK]

for you to show up now![WAIT]
Head to the dungeon I[BREAK]

If you bring it to me...[BREAK]
Then I'll show you a REAL[CONTINUE]
work of art![WAIT]
You'll need this key to[BREAK]

03A-E:Greco: The theme I used[BREAK]
for my dungeon is...[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]austerity[COLOR_OFF] and [COLOR_ON]rusticness[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
The very beauty of...[BREAK]
imperfection.[WAIT]
Enjoy the patina of my[BREAK]

That bird just now was[CONTINUE]
very artistic indeed...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04B-E:Greco: I'm going to use[BREAK]
that bird to make my[CONTINUE]
next work of art![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04C-E:[COLOR_ON]Chekkit[COLOR_OFF] is pretty good,[BREAK]
but if you ask me, I'd say[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s works are better.[WAIT]
I really enjoy his clock[BREAK]
theme.[WAIT]
There's something so[BREAK]
mysterious about it...[CONTINUE]
Don't you think so too?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04D-E:Naturally, the only REAL[BREAK]
artist around here is the[CONTINUE]
great Greco![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04E-E:There was a weird bird[BREAK]

but... I wonder where it[BREAK]
ran off to?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

04F-E:That bird belongs to[BREAK]

050-E:There was a bird with all[BREAK]
its feathers plucked[CONTINUE]
wandering around here[BREAK]
lost and afraid.[WAIT]
Poor thing... I decided[BREAK]
to take it in and care for[CONTINUE]
it myself. Now it's as[BREAK]
happy as can be![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

051-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Greco[COLOR_OFF]'s most treasured[BREAK]
artwork is stored in here.[WAIT]
You can't get in unless[BREAK]
you have the [COLOR_ON]Sesame Key[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

052-E:This is the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF].[CONTINUE]
Unfortunately, you can't[BREAK]
go in because the door[CONTINUE]
is, well... rusted shut.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

053-E:The [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF] and[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]Rustic Room[COLOR_OFF]...[WAIT]
It's like the very names[BREAK]
themselves have an almost[CONTINUE]
bitter taste...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

054-E:I saw it!!! It was a UFO![BREAK]
No doubt about it!!![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

055-E:Very nice.[BREAK]
I too will try going into[CONTINUE]
the [COLOR_ON]Austere Room[COLOR_OFF].[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

to be...?[WAIT]
Hmmm...?[WAIT]
[CENTER_H]''I'm searching for a lost[BREAK]

295-E:Tomaki: Hi there![BREAK]

You've all become a lot[BREAK]
stronger, haven't you?[WAIT]
It's a good idea to make[BREAK]

other by swapping them[CONTINUE]

But, if you don't have a[BREAK]

go the long way through[BREAK]
the [COLOR_ON]sewers[COLOR_OFF].[WAIT]

It's best to get this done[BREAK]
in one try.[WAIT]
That's the safest way,[BREAK]
anyway.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

experience with designer[BREAK]
clothing is gonna be a[CONTINUE]

341-E:[NAME2]: Ah! [NAME1]![BREAK]
That one's MINE![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

342-E:[NAME1]: Oh, really?[WAIT]
But this thing fits me[BREAK]

347-E:[NAME2]: ...I... [SIMPLEWAIT][END]

348-E:[CENTER_HV][SIZE_BIG]HATE IT![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

349-E:[NAME1]: But, if you[BREAK]
don't wear it...[WAIT]
There's no way we can[BREAK]
get into the Lardosseum[CONTINUE]
and take down What.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34A-E:[NAME1]: And if we don't[BREAK]
do that, meeting with[CONTINUE]
[COLOR_ON]Abira[COLOR_OFF] is out of the[BREAK]
question.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

34B-E:[NAME2]: F-...fine.[WAIT]
If it's for my beloved[BREAK]
Abira, I'll deal with it![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7F8-E:Have you visited the house[BREAK]

There, you can learn all[BREAK]

However, it washes right[BREAK]
off with water![WAIT]
If it rains, watch out![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

7FB-E:Everyone calls the huge[BREAK]

They say that the moon[BREAK]
visible above the chapel[CONTINUE]

7FE-E:Do you know about the[BREAK]
[COLOR_ON]CatBat Kid[COLOR_OFF]?[CONTINUE]
 [MENU1]Yup   [MENU2]Nope[MENU_END][END]

7FF-E:That CatBat Kid is a real[BREAK]
die-hard fan of Super Kid[CONTINUE]
Lilby.[WAIT]
For her, he'd even slit[BREAK]
his own mama's throat...[WAIT]
Scary stuff...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

800-E:Careful not to let him[BREAK]
steal your valuables![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

801-E:Thanks to the rain I'm[BREAK]

and unpleasantness with[CONTINUE]
its blessed precipitation...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

804-E:The roots of the magical[BREAK]
tree run all through the[CONTINUE]
earth in this town like a[BREAK]
big web.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

805-E:Stay in this town too long,[BREAK]
and your spirit will get[CONTINUE]
sucked right out![WAIT]
Do you believe it?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

806-E:Did you see it?[CONTINUE]
At the toy cemetery right[BREAK]
before you enter town?[WAIT]
...The ghost of some kid...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

807-E:The rain made the roots[BREAK]
of the magical tree move.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

808-E:3 moving roots remain...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

809-E:2 moving roots remain...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80A-E:1 moving root remains...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80B-E:[NOTE]Raise the roots of the[BREAK]
tree good and well [NOTE][WAIT]
[NOTE]And into the living room[BREAK]
they'll reach and swell [NOTE][SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80C-E:The magical tree's roots[BREAK]
have all been tamed.[WAIT]
Have you tried stopping[BREAK]
by the tree itself?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80D-E:If I can become invisible[BREAK]
again, I'll be sure to play[CONTINUE]
my heart out...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80E-E:Nobody believes it, but...[WAIT]
The magical tree has died.[WAIT]
The sounds of the roots[BREAK]
wiggling in the ground[CONTINUE]
can no longer be heard...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

80F-E:[CENTER_HV]Rain! Rain![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

810-E:Ahh! The magic paint is[BREAK]

If you want it so bad,[BREAK]
just try and catch me![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

817-E:Ge-he-he...[BREAK]
Can't get me in here![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

818-E:[NAME1]: Blast it...![BREAK]
We can't give up here![WAIT]
There's gotta be some[BREAK]
way to get into that tree![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

819-E:[NAME2]: Hey! How about[BREAK]
we jump into the valley?[WAIT]
If you can ride the wind 'n[BREAK]
become a star, then you'll[CONTINUE]
have no trouble getting[BREAK]
the tree to open up![WAIT]
C'mon! Let's go![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81A-E:[NAME1]: No way![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81B-E:[NAME1]: ...For now, let's[BREAK]
head back into town.[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81C-E:Watch out![BREAK]
With this rain, the [COLOR_ON]roots[COLOR_OFF][CONTINUE]
of the magical tree have[BREAK]
started going nuts![WAIT]
They're popping up all[BREAK]
over the place![WAIT]
Check everywhere in town![BREAK]
But, be careful![CONTINUE]
Don't get too close or[BREAK]
they might attack you![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

81D-E:Gi-gi-gi-gi...[BREAK]

way to fight than the[BREAK]
first time around![SIMPLEWAIT][END]

82D-E:Lilby: Hm mmmm...[BREAK]
Who is that over there?[WAIT]
Such a familiar... yet...[BREAK]
revolting voice...[WAIT]
Ahh... I see now.[BREAK]
It is you...[WAIT]
You've come here for my[BREAK]
kiss, haven't you...[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

82E-E:Lilby: Ah... It feels like[BREAK]

A85-E:Am I pretty?[SIMPLEWAIT][END]

A86-E:Professor Enokin is hard[BREAK]

If you eat one, your skin[BREAK]

make this belmush grow...[WAIT]
If only there was some[BREAK]
